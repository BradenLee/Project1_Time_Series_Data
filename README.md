On the graph the x-axis represents time in years, and the y-axis represents the average score per season.
The drop down menus let you add a team to the graph, change the start year, and change the end year.
On each line of the graph there are circles that represent the data for each year. 
The red circles show when their was a drop of more than 7 points from the previous year, and green is a rise of more than 7.
Hovering the mouse over a circle displays the team name, year, and average for that circle.
