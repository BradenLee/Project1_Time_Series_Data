On the graph the x-axis represents time in years, and the y-axis represents the average score per season.
The drop down menus let you add a team to the graph, change the start year, and change the end year.
On each line of the graph there are circles that represent the data for each year. 
The red circles show when their was a drop of more than 7 points from the previous year, and green is a rise of more than 7.
Hovering the mouse over a circle displays the team name, year, and average for that circle.

# Data Observations

In 2015 The Dallas Cowboys lost their quartrback due to an injury. That is reflected in the data by a drop in the average score for that
year. Looking at the circle corresponding to that year it's color is yed indicating they dropped by more than 7 points from the previous year.

In 2018 The Chiefs started Patrick Mahomes as their quarterback. He proved to be one of the best new quarterbacks in the league for the 
2018 season. That is reflected by the data with a huge increase in the average for the chiefs in 2018.
